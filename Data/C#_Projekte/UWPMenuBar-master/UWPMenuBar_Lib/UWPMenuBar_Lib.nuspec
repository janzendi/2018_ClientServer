      This project aims to reimplement the classic menu bar component as a UWP library.

      Currently the library has the following features:

      ## Menu Bar

      The main component is the Menu Bar, which defines a container which can hold Menu Bar buttons, and an optional area which can be used as a drag area for a title bar. It also holds the hover behaviour for opening menu bar items on hover when another one is opened.

      ## Menu Bar Buttons

      These can either have a dropdown (like a menu bar) or are standalone buttons, which can be used for revealing a SplitView. They're also AccessKey aware, meaning users can activate them via `alt + access key`.

      Additionally, they can either display a label or an icon from the built in Segoe MDL2 icon font.

      ## Menu Bar Item / Menu Bar Toggle Item

      These are essentially very small wrappers that wrap the equivalent `MenuFlyoutItem` in order to reduce the default padding on them.

      The padding can be increased / decreased via the normal methods still.
